Drone Swarm Classification with CNN Applied to Radar Signal

Nowadays, there is an urgent neccesity to detect and classify drone swarms, both for military and civilian purposes. One of the most promising methods is detection of drones using a radar signal. It has been proved that RF signatures along with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) provide an accurate approach for classification of the single drones. This repository presents the Python scripts to train, validate and test a deep learning model for classification of drone swarms.
CNN is applied to Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) spectrograms of radar signals that are reflected from a drone swarm due to propellers movement. To train and demonstrate the capabilities of the applied approach, a synthetic dataset has been generated, in which the radar return is described by the mathematical model of Martin and Mulgrew. Realistic parameters of drones and radar are taken from paper
